    "In this midterm we will explore the exponential distribution.  It naturally occurs if the probability of something happening is constant.  For example, the probability that a radioactive nucleus decays is constant.  For this reason the amount of nuclei that did not decay decreased exponentially.  In biochemistry the exponential distribution describes the distributions of times for a reaction.  Lets say you have a process that has a fixed reaction constant.  Than the distribution of waiting times between reactions is given by an exponential distribution.\n",
